In web development with Node.js, a **view engine** serves as a templating engine that enables the use of static template files within an application. During runtime, the engine dynamically replaces variables within these templates with actual values, rendering an HTML file that is then delivered to the client. This approach effectively separates the applicationâ€™s logic from the presentation layer, ensuring a clean, maintainable codebase.

One widely used view engine is **EJS** (Embedded JavaScript), which allows for writing HTML templates embedded with JavaScript. EJS simplifies the process of generating HTML using plain JavaScript and offers intuitive syntax for incorporating JavaScript code directly into the HTML structure.

Additionally, in socket programming:
- Using `socket.emit` ensures that the message is sent **only to the connected client** who initiated the event.
- On the other hand, `socket.broadcast.emit` broadcasts the message to **all other connected clients except the one that triggered the event**.

We will be implementing the **EJS module** to verify its functionality and ensure proper rendering of dynamic content.
