- If we use socket.emit rather than io.emit then only the client will get mesg no one else.
- If you use socket.broadcast .emit then except the client all other will get message.
- In the context of web development with Node.js, a view engine is a template engine that allows you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the view engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This process helps in separating the application logic from the presentation layer.

- EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is one such view engine. It enables you to write HTML templates with embedded JavaScript. EJS makes it easy to generate HTML with plain JavaScript and provides simple syntax for including JavaScript code directly within your HTML.

Additionally, in socket programming:

Using socket.emit ensures that the message is sent only to the connected client who initiated the event.
On the other hand, socket.broadcast.emit broadcasts the message to all other connected clients except the one that triggered the event.
We will be implementing the EJS module to verify its functionality and ensure proper rendering of dynamic content.
